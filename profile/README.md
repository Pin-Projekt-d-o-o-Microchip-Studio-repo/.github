# Pin Projekt d.o.o. Microchip Studio projects

### This organisation is intended for all projects developed in Microchip studio.

### ***These projects are no longer maintained because of change in dev environment from Microchip Studio to Vistual Studio Code + PlatformIO.***
- code development was stopped around 27.2.2024.
- the code is still functional, and could be used for refference

***EDIT 24.4.2024: The code for lotto machine main controller board has been temporarily developed in Microchip Studio because it doesn't work with the newer compiler version in PlatformIO. 
Development will switch over to PlatformIO when new code for AVR USART is written.***
